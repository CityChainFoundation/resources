# Resources: Merchants

[...Back](README.md)

The Smart City Platform, will have a Point-of-Sale (POS) app and service that integrates seamlessly with various crypto-currencies. The POS solution will support centralized encrypted storage, for backup and synchronization. This will be a paid service, but the solution can also be used for free. With the paid service, a merchant will get the ability to share data across all their POS terminals, so management of products, table layout for restaurants and more, can be done centrally on a single device, or in the field using a tablet or phone.

While the software is platform agnostic and will be made available for iOS (iPad/iPhone) and Windows, we are planning on making a complete hardware setup with cash registry, recipept printer and touch-based POS built on the Microsoft's Surface Go tablet, which is a 10" fully featured PC. It is small enough for restaurants to use them to take orders at the tables.
